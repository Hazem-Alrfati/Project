        <h2>A Beginner's Guide For Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning specializes in how computers simulate or implement
          human learning behavior to acquire new knowledge or skills, and
          reorganize existing knowledge structures to improve their performance
          continuously. It is a subset of artificial intelligence. Any system
          without learning ability can hardly be considered a real intelligent
          system.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning System elements:</h3>

          <li>Algorithm</li>
          <li>Computing power</li>

        <h3>Basic Terms and Concepts (1)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Dataset:</span> refers to a set of data used in machine
            learning tasks. Each piece of data is called a sample. The event or
            attribute that reflects the performance or nature of a sample in a
            certain aspect is called a feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Training set:</span> refers to a dataset used in the training
            process, where each sample is referred to as a training sample. The
            process of learning a model from data is called learning (training).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Test set:</span> Test refers to the process of using the
            learnt model for prediction. The dataset used is called a test set,
            and each sample is called a test sample.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Basic Terms and Concepts (2)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Generalization capability:</span> The goal of machine learning
            is that the learnt model should perform well on new samples, not
            just those on which the model has been trained. The ability to
            perform well on new samples is called generalization capability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Error:</span> refers to the difference between the sample
            result predicted by the learnt model and the actual sample result.
            <ul>
              <li>Training error: error of the model on the training set</li>
              <li>
                Generalization error: error on the new sample. Obviously, we
                prefer a model with a smaller generalization error.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Underfitting:</span> occurs when the training error is too
            large.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Overfitting:</span> occurs when the training error of the
            learnt model is small but the generalization error is large (weak
            generalization capability).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Basic Terms and Concepts (3)</h3>
        <p>
          Many kinds of tasks can be solved with machine learning. The following
          describes the most typical and common types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Classification:</span> The computer program is asked to
            specify which of k categories some input belongs to, For example,
            the image classification algorithm in computer vision is to solve a
            classification task.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Regression:</span> In this type of task, the computer program
            is asked to predict a numerical value given some input, An example
            of a regression task is the prediction of the expected claim amount
            that an insured person will make (used to set insurance premiums),
            or the prediction of future prices of securities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Classification and regression are two major types of prediction tasks.
          The outputs of classification are discrete type values while the
          outputs of regression are consecutive values.
        </p>
        <h3>How Machine Learning Work?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>A Decision Process:</span> In general, machine learning
            algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on
            some input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm
            will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>An Error Function:</span> An error function serves to evaluate
            the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error
            function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>An Model Optimization Process:</span> If the model can fit
            better to the data points in the training set, then weights are
            adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the
            model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize
            process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy
            has been met.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Machine learning Methods</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><span>Supervised machine learning</span></li>
          <p>
            Based on the samples of known classes, obtain an optimal model with
            required performance through training and learning. Then, the model
            is used to map all inputs to outputs and perform simple judgment on
            outputs (classification). This model classifies unknown data. “image
            and speech recognition, forecasting, classification (predict a
            label), regression (predict a quantity)”
          </p>
          <li><span>Unsupervised machine learning </span></li>
          <p>
            Unsupervised learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze
            and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden
            patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
            Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information
            make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis,
            cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, image and pattern
            recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a
            model through the process of dimensionality reduction; principal
            component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are
            two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in
            unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering,
            probabilistic clustering methods, and more.
          </p>
          <li><span>Semi-supervised learning </span></li>
          <p>
            Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised
            and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller
            labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from
            a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the
            problem of having not enough labeled data (or not being able to
            afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning
            algorithm.
          </p>
          <li>
            <span>Reinforcement learning:</span>
          </li>
          <p>
            Learning systems learn mappings from environments to actions to
            maximize the value of the reward signal (reinforcement signal)
            function. The difference between reinforcement learning and
            supervised learning is the teacher signal. The reinforcement signal
            provided by the environment in reinforcement learning is an
            assessment on the action (scalar signal) rather than telling the
            learning system how to perform correct actions. “ have rules, win a
            game with strategy”
          </p>
